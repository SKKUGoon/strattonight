# User Interface

Basic user interface is done with commands. 
`for` loop listens for `stdin`. User can type 
their commands after `stratton >>`. 

```bash
stratton >>
```

Some examples for commands are 

1. test-command
2. static-ping
3. stream-test-init
4. stream-test-exit
5. exit, quit or `ctrl-c`
